Soccer Stats Reports

This project aims at creating a Python-program capable of genereating automated soccer stats reports.
Each report is: in .PDF format, c. 30 pages, c. 50 graphs (powered by Matplolib), c. 50 soccer parameters analyzed.
Data source: RapidAPI.com

Because the purpose of this project is eventually to sell the reports (through a subscription plan, offer TBD), some files have intentionally been removed from the repository.

You can find a report example in this repository "report_example"

Feel free to reach if anything.

Enjoy!
